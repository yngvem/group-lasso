If you are looking for efficient and scikit-learn-like models with group structure such **Group Lasso** and **Group Logistic Regression**, you better opt for [``skglm``](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm).


The ``skglm`` package extends the features of ``scikit-learn`` to Generalized Linear Models providing a wealth of models.
Check out the [documentation](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/api.html) for the full list of supported models.
Also, view ``skglm``'s Gallery of examples to see its speed and efficiency when tackling large scale problems.
