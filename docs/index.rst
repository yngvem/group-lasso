Efficient Group Lasso in Python
===============================

.. Caution::

    This package is no longer maintained and it is advised to use `skglm <https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm>`_ instead.

    ``skglm`` provides efficient and scikit-learn-compatible models with group structure such as `Group Lasso <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/generated/skglm.GroupLasso.html#skglm.GroupLasso>`_ and Group Logistic Regression.
    It extends the features of ``scikit-learn`` for Generalized Linear Models by implementing a wealth of missing models.
    Check out the `documentation <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/api.html>`_ for the full list of supported models, and the  `Gallery of examples <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to see its speed and efficiency when tackling large scale problems.
