Efficient Group Lasso with skglm
================================

This package is no longer maintained and it is highly recommended to use `skglm <https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm>`_.
There, you can find efficient and scikit-learn-compatible models with group structure such **Group Lasso** and **Group Logistic Regression**,

The ``skglm`` package extends the features of ``scikit-learn`` to Generalized Linear Models providing a wealth of models.
Check out the `documentation <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/api.html>`_ for the full list of supported models.
Also, view ``skglm``'s `Gallery of examples <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to see its speed and efficiency when tackling large scale problems.
