If you are looking for efficient and scikit-learn-like models with group structure such **Group Lasso** and **Group Logistic Regression**, have a look at `skglm <https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm>`_


``skglm`` provides efficient and scikit-learn-compatible models with group structure such as `Group Lasso <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/generated/skglm.GroupLasso.html#skglm.GroupLasso>`_ and Group Logistic Regression.
It extends the features of ``scikit-learn`` for Generalized Linear Models by implementing a wealth of missing models.
Check out the `documentation <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/api.html>`_ for the full list of supported models, and the  `Gallery of examples <https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/auto_examples/index.html>`_ to see its speed and efficiency when tackling large scale problems.


If you are looking for the ``grouplasso`` documentation, view the `old version of the README <./old_README.rst>`_.
