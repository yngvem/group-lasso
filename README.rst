⚠️ This package is no longer maintained. An efficient and sklearn compatible [Group Lasso](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/skglm/generated/skglm.GroupLasso.html) implementation can be found in [``skglm``](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/skglm).

The `skglm` package extends the features of `sklearn` for generalized lienar models, providing other group models (e.g. group logistic regression), positivity constraints, non-convex penalties, etc. Its fast solvers can handle problems with million of features in a few seconds.


The previous version of the README is in `old_README.rst`.
